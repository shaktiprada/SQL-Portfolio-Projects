# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills by analysing data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving various business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_dataset` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing the analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbo.Customers
WHERE customer_id IS NULL
    OR customer_name IS NULL
    OR reg_date IS NULL;
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

```sql
select 
	order_slots,
	count(*) as total_orders
from
(
	select 
		case
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 0 and 1 then ' :00 - 02:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 2 and 3 then '02:00 - 04:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 4 and 5 then '04:00 - 06:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 6 and 7 then '06:00 - 08:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 8 and 9 then '08:00 - 10:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 10 and 11 then '10:00 - 12:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 12 and 13 then '12:00 - 14:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 14 and 15 then '14:00 - 16:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 16 and 17 then '16:00 - 18:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 18 and 19 then '18:00 - 20:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 20 and 21 then '20:00 - 22:00'
		when DATEPART(HOUR,order_time) between 22 and 23 then '22:00 - 00:00'
		end as order_slots
	from
		orders
)as x
group by 
	order_slots
order by 
	total_orders desc
```
**Approach 2:**
```sql
WITH TimeIntervals AS (
    SELECT 
        FLOOR(DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) / 2) * 2 AS start_time,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 
        FLOOR(DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) / 2) * 2
)
SELECT 
    concat(start_time,'-',start_time + 2) as order_slots,
    total_orders
FROM TimeIntervals
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```
### 2. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by a customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
SELECT
	TOP 10
	CUSTOMER_NAME,
	ORDER_ITEM
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		--O.customer_id,
		C.customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
		COUNT(*) AS MOST_ORDERED,
		O.order_item AS ORDER_ITEM
	FROM 
		orders O
	JOIN
		customers C
	ON O.customer_id = C.customer_id
	WHERE
		customer_name LIKE '%ARJUN MEHTA%'
		AND
		Order_Date BETWEEN DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE()) AND GETDATE()
	GROUP BY 
		C.customer_name,
		O.order_item	
) AS X
ORDER BY 
		MOST_ORDERED DESC
```

**Approach 2:**

```sql
SELECT 
	CUSTOMER_NAME,
	ORDER_ITEM,
	MOST_ORDERED,
	RANKS
FROM(
	SELECT 
		C.customer_name AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
		COUNT(*) AS MOST_ORDERED,
		O.order_item AS ORDER_ITEM,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ) AS RANKS
	FROM 
		orders O
	JOIN
		customers C
	ON O.customer_id = C.customer_id
	WHERE C.customer_name LIKE '%ARJUN MEHTA%'
    AND
		--O.order_date BETWEEN '2023-03-03' AND '2023-12-31'
		Order_Date BETWEEN DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE()) AND GETDATE()
	GROUP BY 
		O.order_item,C.customer_name
) AS X
WHERE X.RANKS <= 5
```
